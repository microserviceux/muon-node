# Muon Node

Muon Node is the implementation of the Muon microservices toolkit, for the Node.js platform. Muon enables you to easily build
microservices in many languages that have richer, more performant and fully reactive communication semantics and gain access
to Muon compatible services written in other languages without having to sacrifice the rich semantics or performance.
