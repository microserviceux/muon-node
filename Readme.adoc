# Muon Core - NodeJS


NodeJS implementation of Muon, a polyglot microservices communications framework. Muon enables you to easily build
microservices in many languages that have richer, more performant and fully reactive communication semantics and gain access
to Muon compatible services written in other languages without having to sacrifice the rich semantics or performance. 

Muon was designed from the ground up with 4 core ideas in mind:

1.) Communicaiton,transactions and protocols useds are the biggest issues facing microservices
2.) easily pluggable protocols (currently rpc, streaming, evnts, pielining)
3.) Easily pluggable transports (current supports only amqp)
4.) Testing (dev, test and production should not differ)



# Examples

You'll need RabbitMQ running for transport, try running our demo VM over here preconfigured for this demo: https://github.com/muoncore/muon-dev-vm


open a terminal and run the exmaples service:

```
node examples/muon-dev-tools-server.js

```



now open another terminal window and run a client to test some of the exmaple services:


### echo service

this exmaple service endpoint echos back it's given payload.

```
node ./examples/dev-tools-echo-client.js
```


### ping service

This example service responds to a payload with contents 'ping' with a 'pong' message.

```
node ./examples/dev-tools-ping-client.js
```



### random number service

Generates a random number between 10000 & 99999.

```
node ./examples/dev-tools-random-client.js
```


### type id service

identifies the javascript type of the payload and responds back.

```
node ./examples/dev-tools-type-client.js

```




### uuid service

Generate a uuid

```
node ./examples/dev-tools-uuid-client.js

```

## Publishing this repo

Run

```
make publish
```

This will transpile the source to ES5, and publish it to NPM.
