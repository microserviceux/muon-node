# Muon Core - NodeJS


NodeJS implementation of Muon, a polyglot mciroservices communications framework. Why? Because RPC/HTTP/REST are terrible protocols for microsrvices. Muon is a polyglot, multi protocol, high opinionated, inter-communicaiton API for microservices that handles discovery and message transport. Muon currently supports RPC, Streaming, and Piplining (think posix pipes, one way messaging passing, what Alan Kaye originally intended when he was thinking about OO). 





# Examples


open a terminal and run the exmaples service:

```
node examples/muon-dev-tools-server.js

```



now open another terminal window and run a client to test some of the exmaple services:


### echo service

```
node ./examples/dev-tools-echo-client.js
```

```
node ./examples/dev-tools-ping-client.js
```



### random number service

Generates a random number between 10000 & 99999.

```
node ./examples/dev-tools-random-client.js
```


### type id service

identifies the javascript type of the payload and responds back.

```
node ./examples/dev-tools-type-client.js

```




### uuid service

Generate a uuid

```
node ./examples/dev-tools-uuid-client.js
